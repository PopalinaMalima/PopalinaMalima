Love to read and apparently love/tend to overthink everything, but i guess that just means I’m great at spotting bugs before its too late (and then overthinking the fix, of course...).
I`m also lazy so it means that I code to automate the boring stuff so I don’t have to do it again. If I can make life easier with a few lines of code, you bet I will.
Also, I love learning weird, new, cool techy things just so I can use them in the most unnecessarily creative ways possible.
